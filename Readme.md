Given an array of positive integers, for example:
```
$dataset = [ 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21 ];
```

You need to write a class that contains one or more public methods that, using different methods if there are several (more is better), return the smallest number in the array after the passed argument or -1 in case of an error. For example:

```
$classInstance->methodName(11) => 10
$classInstance->methodName(14) => 12
```

You also need to write unit tests for the class using PHPUnit. No frameworks or libraries other than PHPUnit should be used.
